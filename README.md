# Vision-Transformer-for-leaf-disease-detection
*Developed a custom ShiftedPatchTokenization layer to enhance the standard patch extraction process by including diagonally shifted patches, improving spatial information capture.
*Enhanced the multi-head attention mechanism with a learnable temperature parameter (MultiHeadAttentionLSA) and a diagonal attention mask, improving the model's attention focus.
*chieved around 90% + accuracy on apple, grape, corn, and tomato disease classification from plant village dataset with up to 5 classes.
*Training time was efficient, taking only 2-3 minutes per epoch.
*Deployed model on an app with user friendly interface.
